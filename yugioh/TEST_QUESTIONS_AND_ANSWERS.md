Answers:
- A. Tim kann ΓÇ£SternenstaubdracheΓÇ¥ als Tribut w├ñhrend des Damage Steps anbieten, um den Zerst├╢rungseffekt von ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ zu annulieren. Der Effekt von   ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ sendet die obersten 3 Karten von Shirleys Deck auf den Friedhof.  
- B. Tim kann seinen ΓÇ₧SternenstaubdracheΓÇ£ nicht als Tribut anbieten, um den Effekt von ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ zu annulieren, denn der Effekt von ΓÇ₧SternenstaubdracheΓÇ£ kann nicht im Damage Step aktiviert werden. 
- [CORRECT] C. Tim kann ΓÇ£SternenstaubdracheΓÇ¥ als Tribut w├ñhrend des Damage Steps anbieten, um den Zerst├╢rungseffekt von ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ zu annulieren. Da der erste Effekt von  ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ annuliert worden ist, ist der komplette Effekt annuliert. Der Effekt von ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ wird keine Karten von Shirleys Deck auf den Friedhof senden. 
- D. Tim kann ΓÇ£SternenstaubdracheΓÇ¥ nur als Tribut anbieten, um den Zerst├╢rungseffekt von ΓÇ£Ryko, Lichtverpflichteter J├ñgerΓÇ¥ zu annulieren, weil Shirley gew├ñhlt hat, ein Monster zu zerst├╢ren.
