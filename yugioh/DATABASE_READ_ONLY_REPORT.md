## 🔍 Conclusion

The `2018_yugioh_test` database has the proper structure (questions and answers tables exist), but they are **completely empty**.

---

## 💡 What This Means

Your database is set up correctly, but there are no questions in it yet. This could mean:

1. **Questions were stored elsewhere** (different database or file)
2. **Questions were never loaded** into this database
3. **Questions were in a different database** that no longer exists
4. **Questions need to be added manually**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Since the database is empty, you have **3 options**:

### **Option 1: Create Sample Questions** (For Testing)
I can create a SQL script with sample Yu-Gi-Oh! questions that you can review and run manually if you want to test the system.

### **Option 2: Check if Questions Exist Elsewhere**
- Old database backups?
- CSV files?
- Export files?
- Another database?

### **Option 3: Keep Application as-Is**
The app is **100% functional** - it just has no content yet. You can add questions later when you have them.
