      <p>The goal of the Konami Judge Program is to provide support and guidance for judges, encourage them to improve
        their skills and knowledge, and offer Certification Testing to recognize their efforts and
        accomplishments.<br>

      <p><b>You must pass the Rulings Certification Level 1 Test (RC-1) before you will be eligible to register in the
          Konami Judge Program.<br>
          Passing the RC-1 will not automatically register you as a Konami Judge.<br>
          After passing the RC-1, you must complete an online form in order to register as a Konami Judge.</b></p>
      <p> By passing certification tests, a judge can evaluate their knowledge of the various aspects of judging.
        While passing the RC-1 is required to join the Konami Judge Program, all registered Konami Judges are
        encouraged to actively pursue additional Judge Certification.</p>
      <p> <b>Level 1</b> Certification Tests are offered online.<br>
        <b>Level 2</b> Certification Tests are offered in-person.<br>
