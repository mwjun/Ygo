## 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

### **Step 1: Add Questions to Database** ⭐

Your database is empty. You need questions so users can take tests.

**I just fixed the query** to work with your existing database structure (removed language column requirement).

**Now choose one**:

#### **Option A: Check if Old Database Has Questions**

```bash
mysql -u root -e "USE 2018_yugioh_test; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE test_name='rulings';"
```

If this shows questions exist, your new API should be able to use them!

#### **Option B: Add Sample Questions for Testing**

I can create a SQL script with sample Yu-Gi-Oh! questions for testing.

### **Step 2: Update Components to Load Questions**

Your Angular components need to:
1. Call `getQuestions()` when page loads
2. Display questions on screen
3. Collect answers when user selects them

---

### **Step 3: Update Components to Submit Answers**

Your test pages need to:
1. Collect all answers into a Map
2. Call `submitTest()` when user clicks Submit
3. Display the result (score, pass/fail)

---

### **Step 4: Test Complete Flow**

1. Age verification ✅
2. Questions load ✅
3. Answers submitted ✅
4. Score calculated ✅
