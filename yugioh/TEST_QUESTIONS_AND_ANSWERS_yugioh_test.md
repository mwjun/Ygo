<u>Premature Burial</u><br/>
<b>Equip Spell</b><br/>
<i>Activate this card by paying 800 Life Points, then target 1 monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that target in face-up Attack Position and equip it with this card. When this card is destroyed, destroy the equipped monster.</i><br/><br/>

<u>Solemn Judgment</u><br/>
<b>Counter Trap</b><br/>
<i>When a monster would be Summoned, OR a Spell/Trap Card is activated: Pay half your Life Points; negate the Summon or action, and if you do, destroy that card.</i>
Answers:
- Once Ivy chooses her target for "Premature Burial," her opponent can no longer respond with "Solemn Judgment" to negate the activation.
- [CORRECT] Ivy must pay all costs and choose all targets upon activation of "Premature Burial."  After she does, Priority is passed to her opponent, who may then respond with "Solemn Judgment."
- "Premature Burial" does not target, so Ivy does not have to choose the monster she wishes to Special Summon until "Premature Burial" resolves.
- Ivy must pay all costs and choose all targets upon activation of "Premature Burial."  After she does, Priority is passed to her opponent, who may then respond with "Solemn Judgment."
